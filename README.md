Create a dictionary using test driven development

## What?
We are creating a friendly learning tool with which to practice the human language.
You will have to type in a four letter word, and then you will be given a definition and you will have to match the definition
with the word.

## Wireframes

## How?
TDD! Blood sweat and tears (mostly from Robert).

File Structure
* server.js and package.json
* main.js - this file holds the functions which will search the words from the words.txt and also access th definiton from the API.
* words.txt -
* test folder - everyone will have there own test files so as to avoid merge conflicts.
* index.html and style.css and pack


Process
* npm intall shot and tape
* Make a function in the file main.js which can make the words.txt into an array and can search this array.
* Find a way in which the server can access the data input on html page.
